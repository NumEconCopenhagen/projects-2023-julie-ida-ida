Our project is titled INAUGURAL PROJECT and is about a household model with a male and female member.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
We find that the model fit data the best when $\alpha = 0.98$ and $\sigma = .0.1$. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
