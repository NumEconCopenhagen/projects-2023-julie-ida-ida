This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. We look at a household where we look at how the wage affects time used working at home. Furthermore, we see how the allocation of time changes for different values of the parameters. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from Denmarks Statistics (DST). We use the wage for men and woman in Denmark (LONS50). Furthermore, we use GDP data for Denmark (NAHO2).
3. Model project. We model an OLG-model and make a further analysis with different values of the population growth, n, to see how the steady state for capital accumulation will change.
4. Exam project. We solve 3 exercises about Optimal taxation with government consumption, Labor adjustment costs, and lobal optimizer with refined multi-start.
