# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **MODEL PROJECT** and is about the OLG model with two overlapping generations (an young and an old generation) and how the capital accumulation changes with population growth, n.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). We find that the numerically and analyticcaly solution to the problem results in the same value for steady state. Furthermore, we find that when population growth, n, is increasing the value of steady state for capital accumulation will decrease. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
